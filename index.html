    <div class="para">[1] Shabeen Ahmad v. The State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. (Criminal Appeal No. 1051 of 2025) decided on 03 March 2025 by Vikram Nath and Sandeep Mehta, JJ. Issue for consideration pertains to the correctness of the order passed by the High Court granting bail to in-laws of the deceased wife, charged for causing dowry death.</div>

    <div class="para">[2] The matter involved death of the wife within two years of marriage in suspicious circumstances. Trial court rejected the bail applications, but the High Court granted bail.

Mechanical approach adopted by the High Court led to cancellation of bail to parents-in-law, while bail to sisters-in-law was upheld. [Paras 11-18]</div>
