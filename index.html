Issue for consideration pertains to the correctness of the order passed by the High Court granting bail to in-laws of the deceased wife, charged for causing dowry death.<sup><a href="#cite1">[1]</a></sup></div>

    <div class="para" id="126">The matter involved death of the wife within two years of marriage in suspicious circumstances.

Mechanical approach adopted by the High Court led to cancellation of bail to parents-in-law, while bail to sisters-in-law was upheld. [Paras 11-18]<sup><a href="#cite2">[2]</a></sup></div>
