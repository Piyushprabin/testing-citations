  <div class="section" id="overview">
    <h3>1. Case Overview</h3>
    <p>This case involves an appeal against the bail granted by the Allahabad High Court to in-laws of a deceased woman who allegedly died due to dowry-related violence. The trial court had earlier rejected their bail applications based on serious allegations of dowry death.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 1-2]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="fir">
    <h3>2. FIR Details and Allegations</h3>
    <p>The deceased, Shahida Bano, was married on 07.02.2022. The FIR, filed on 23.01.2024, alleges persistent dowry demands—including a "Bullet" motorcycle and later a car. The FIR names the husband, his parents, and his two sisters as accused.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 3-4]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="death">
    <h3>3. Circumstances of Death</h3>
    <p>On 22.01.2024, the deceased was found hanging with a dupatta tied to a fan, her knees still on the bed. Post-mortem revealed multiple ante-mortem injuries and asphyxia due to strangulation, indicating a possible homicide rather than suicide.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 5-6]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="investigation">
    <h3>4. Investigative Findings</h3>
    <p>Statements under Section 161 CrPC corroborated ongoing harassment and dowry-related cruelty by the in-laws. Based on this, the Sessions Court denied bail. The High Court, however, granted bail citing no prior criminal records and other humanitarian grounds.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 7-9]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="scrutiny">
    <h3>5. Supreme Court’s Scrutiny</h3>
    <p>The Supreme Court emphasized the need for stricter scrutiny in dowry death cases. It held that superficial reasoning in bail orders dilutes the judiciary’s stance against dowry deaths. The parents-in-law were deemed to have a principal role and their bail was revoked.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 10-13]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="sisters">
    <h3>6. Sisters-in-law: Lesser Role</h3>
    <p>The Court acknowledged that the sisters-in-law had relatively minor involvement. One was recently married, and the other was a student and teacher. Their bail was upheld due to mitigating personal factors, though this does not absolve them of the charges.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 14]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="critique">
    <h3>7. Critique of High Court’s Approach</h3>
    <p>The Court criticized the High Court for a mechanical approach in granting bail. It highlighted prior judgments requiring courts to assess the gravity of the offence, societal impact, and risk of undermining justice before granting bail.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 15-16]</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" id="final">
    <h3>8. Final Directions</h3>
    <p>The Supreme Court cancelled the bail for the father-in-law and mother-in-law, directing them to surrender. The sisters-in-law's bail remained intact with strict adherence to conditions. The trial court was asked to expedite proceedings independently.</p>
    <p class="citation">[Para 17-21]</p>
